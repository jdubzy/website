				hello everybody this is jojo an today i just want to talk about the current
		        state of the internet. i miss when the web was a place you went on and if you knew some
		        basic html could make your own place within it. Now most of the userspace of the internet 
		        is owned by 3 or 4 megacorps using algorithms, ai and other things to keep you on the site so 
		        they can shove ads down your thoat and make money off you by selling user data. I miss when the
		        internet was less corporate and more like the wild west where it was a fronteir of self-expression
		        and having stake in your own personal homestead of cyberspace. The internet seemed more fun back then
		        years ago then it does now. that is all i have to say and think you for coming to my ted talk

				 hello everybody reading this I've been teaching myself javascript so i can make web games and apps for fun. 
		         i have a couple of ideas of what i want to make and mabye i can make my ideas a reality after some practice. 
		         i remember when i was in college they tried to teach me javascript but most of it went over my head and i had 
		         a bunch of things going on in my life then so i dropped out of college after one semester. im in a better place 
		         now and decided to self-teach instead of going back to college.
