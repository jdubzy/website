		the internet seems to be boring now due to being controled by big tech corporations and being steralized killing off the individualism and wonder of what the world wide web once was.
		It used to be fun surfing the internet not knowing where the next link would bring you and enjoying seeing new things and interesting communities instead of the same handfull of sites 
		that everyone goes to now.The cheezy hand-crafted websites were fun to look at seeing the creativity and learning about the person who created it.Now the culture of the internet has 
		changed from personal websites for fun to social media sites that have skinner-box like mechanics to control how users interact with each other and how they consume ideas in general. 
		i miss the old internet and wish it would come back.
