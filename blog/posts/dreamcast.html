hello everybody i got an sega dreamcast for christmas from my mom. I always wanted one out of the nostalgia for when i had one when i was little and used to play it all the time with my brother. 
i remember playing sonic adventure and powerstone alot when i was little. to me the dreamcast is one of the most underrated game consoles of all time. it had a decent libary of games and was the 
first game console to have online multiplayer gaming. i was sad when my mom sold my dreamcast for money when i was little but she bought me one for christmas so its ok and all forgiven. 
in conclusion got me a sega dreamcast for christmas and spent some time with the fam.
