		hello everybody it's me jojo. I know it's been awhile since i posted here but im here today to post about what i've been doing for the last few months. 
        first off, i've been working on multiple projects so i have very little time to write blog posts on my website. The projects i've been working on are 
        low-poly 3d models that i can turn into papercraft models and a game in rpg maker mv. If the papercraft models turn out good i might make a section on 
        my website to share them and make them avalable to download here. also, when it's done, publish my rpg maker game on the itch.io website. so that's what 
        i've been doing for the last months and hope everything turns out great.
