			as you can see with the screenshot above the answer is using the echo command to print the phrase hello world to the screen. you can also use printf but i chose to use echo
			to keep it simple.
			<p>
			<code class="language-sh">
				echo "hello world"
			</code>
		    </p>
		</p>
		
		<h1>level 2</h1>
