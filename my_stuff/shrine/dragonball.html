		<p>
			as for many people my age dragonball z was my first introduction to the world of anime. i used to watch it on toonami with my cousin and brother after school everyday when it came on cartoon network.
			I enjoyed watching goku and all the other z fighters go on adventures and fight enemys and the bad guys. I remember this anime series very fondly. till this very day im still a fan of dragonball z
			and anime as a whole.
