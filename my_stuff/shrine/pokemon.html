			for those that dont know pokemon is a game, anime series and card game that started in the 90s. I have fond memories of pokemon because i used to watch it on tv everyday after school with my brother and cousin. i remember having fun
            watching ash and his friends go on adventures and being excited where the story will go next. also, i had a green gameboy color that i played the living crap of pokemon yellow on. it was a good time and pokemon gives me good memories
            till this very day. I still enjoy playing the pokemon games they hold up very well in my eyes.
