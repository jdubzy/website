			hello everybody this is jojo and right now im reviewing the comic boys club. the small series of comics follow 4 slacker/stoner roommates: andy, landwolf, brett and the most known out of the bunch pepe the frog.
            throughout the comic they get into a bunch of comedic mischief similar to college frat boys and stoner humor like cheech and chong. its an ok comic with a few comedic moments that people the age 25 or
            under would enjoy. overall, this comic is a good read if you are into that sort of stuff.
