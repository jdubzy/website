			hello everybody this is jojo and today im going to review sensory: life on the spectrum. Sensory: Life on the Spectrum" is a vibrant and heartfelt anthology that offers a unique glimpse into the lives of autistic individuals 
            through the medium of comics. this collection features contributions from thirty autistic creators, each sharing their personal experiences, challenges, and triumphs. The comics cover a wide range of topics, from the journey to 
            diagnosis to finding community and coping mechanisms for sensory overload. The illustrations are as diverse as the stories themselves, ranging from soft, paint-like depictions to jagged, dark drawings, each adding a distinct 
            emotional depth to the narratives. Overall, "Sensory: Life on the Spectrum" is a must-read for anyone looking to explore the autistic experience through a creative and engaging format. It's a testament to the strength and resilience 
            of autistic individuals and a celebration of their diverse voices.
