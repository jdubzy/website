		  Remember when crypto was about decentralization, empowerment, and giving power back to the people? When the dream was to build a new kind of internet — open, borderless, and community-owned? 
		  Yeah, that’s all gone now. What started as a digital rebellion against Wall Street has slowly become Wall Street with worse UX and more memes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Crypto used to attract hackers, artists, and idealists — people who wanted to change how money worked. Then the finance bros showed up. Suddenly, it wasn’t about innovation; it was about yield farming, pump-and-dumps, and “number go up.” 
		The space became an echo chamber of alpha calls, “networking” on yachts, and endless Twitter threads about how someone’s dog coin was going to “revolutionize payments.”
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, the culture feels less like the cypherpunk underground and more like a frat house with Bloomberg terminals. Every project has a “tokenomics lead” and a “growth hacker,” but no one seems interested in actually building something useful. The ethos of decentralization got replaced by the hustle culture of speculation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Crypto didn’t just get co-opted — it got rebranded into another asset class for people who already had too many. And in the process, it lost the very thing that made it exciting in the first place: purpose.

        Maybe, someday, the idealists will take it back. Until then, it’s hard not to look at crypto and think: we wanted freedom, and all we got was finance bros in Patagonia vests talking about “liquidity.”
