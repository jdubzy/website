		  hello everybody this is jojo an today i just want to talk about the current
		  state of the internet. i miss when the web was a place you went on and if you knew some
		  basic html could make your own place within it. Now most of the userspace of the internet 
		  is owned by 3 or 4 megacorps using algorithms, ai and other things to keep you on the site so 
		  they can shove ads down your thoat and make money off you by selling user data. I miss when the
		  internet was less corporate and more like the wild west where it was a fronteir of self-expression
		  and having stake in your own personal homestead of cyberspace. The internet seemed more fun back then
		  years ago then it does now. that is all i have to say and think you for coming to my ted talk
