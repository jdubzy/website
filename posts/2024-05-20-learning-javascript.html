		  hello everybody reading this I've been teaching myself javascript so i can make web games and apps for fun. 
		  i have a couple of ideas of what i want to make and mabye i can make my ideas a reality after some practice. 
		  i remember when i was in college they tried to teach me javascript but most of it went over my head and i had 
		  a bunch of things going on in my life then so i dropped out of college after one semester. im in a better place 
		  now and decided to self-teach instead of going back to college
