		  Remember when cyberpunk was just a sci-fi genre with neon-lit streets, oppressive mega-corporations, and a society under constant surveillance? 
		  Turns out, we don’t need to wait for the future. We’re already there. In today’s world, a handful of corporate giants own everything—from your social media 
		  feed to your online shopping habits. Amazon, Google, Meta, Apple, Microsoft and others have more control over the economy, infrastructure, and even public discourse 
		  than most governments. These companies don’t just sell products—they shape how we live, communicate, and think. And yes, we’re all being watched. Surveillance isn’t just 
		  for criminals anymore. Your smartphone tracks your location. Your smart TV listens to your conversations. Algorithms mine your data to predict (and manipulate) your behavior. 
		  This isn’t paranoia—it’s business as usual in a world where your attention is the most valuable commodity. What makes this worse? Most of us have signed up willingly. We’ve 
		  traded privacy for convenience, agency for algorithms, and independence for free shipping. So if the cyberpunk aesthetic was neon and rain-soaked cities, today’s version is 
		  glowing screens, corporate logos, and an endless scroll. Welcome to the dystopia. You’re already logged in.
